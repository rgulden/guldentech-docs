# Alerting

GuldenTech provides the ability for your website to be monitored in case of some unexpected downage. We leverage kuma-uptime to curl your website every 60 seconds to make sure it is still running. Kuma will post a alert to the GuldenTech discord alerting everyone about the issue. This can be customed to send you a notification a different way.

!> Please create a issue with the tag **monitoring** and provide information on your website URL and where you would like the notification to go to.
