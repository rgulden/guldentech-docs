# Creating a test, build and deploy pipeline with Rancher

Please review the Rancher pipeline documentation page here (https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/pipelines/) for creating pipelines.

But the essential part is making sure on the Rancher console you follow the steps outlined after clicking "Configure Repos".

If it's your first time it will ask you to setup your connection to github. Follow the steps it says.

## Rancher Pipeline YAML

Your repo will need a .rancher-pipeline.yaml file which will facilitate the pipeline. 

Below is a basic Build and deploy example.

```yaml
stages:
- name: Publish
  steps:
  - publishImageConfig:
      dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
      buildContext: .
      tag: image-name:v1.0
    env:
      PLUGIN_MTU: "1230"
- name: Deploy
  steps:
  - applyYamlConfig:
      path: ./deploy.yaml
```

Above defines it will first build an image from the "Dockerfile" file at the root of your repo, push it to the local registry with the name image-name:v1.0. Following that, it will run kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml. 

!> Make sure your namespace is defined in your deploy file.

## Deploy config settings

In your deploy.yaml file you will need to add three special sections. 

1. Pipeline secrets
2. Image name
3. Git Commit

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
	  imagePullSecrets:           # <----- 1.
      - name: pipeline-docker-registry
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: ${CICD_IMAGE}:v1.0 # <----- 2.
		env:
        - name: CICD_GIT_COMMIT   # <----- 3.
          value: "${CICD_GIT_COMMIT}"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Alerts for failures

If you would like, we can configure alerts to the pipeline yaml file that will send you an email on conditions.

```yaml
stages: {}
notification:
  recipients:
  - recipient: "test@example.com"
    notifier: "c-hmqnj:n-xv76m"
  # Select which statuses you want the notification to be sent
  condition: ["Failed", "Success", "Changed"]
  # Ability to override the default message (Optional)
  message: "my-message"

```
